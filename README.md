## About

Use this Loan Calculator to estimate your monthly or bi-weekly loan payments. 
You can input different loan types, loan balance, loan term, and interest rate to see how your monthly or bi-weekly payments change. 
If you have more than one loan, you can continue adding them and see the total monthly or bi-weekly payments. You can also remove any of the loans from the list. 

## Role and Impact

Solo project - I built a fully functional loan calculator app from scratch. To differentiate my app from the rest of the loan calculators available online, I added the following features below:
First - Users can select their loan type or create a new loan name as preferred; 
Second - Users can add several loans in one calculation of their loan payments; 
Third - Users can select payment frequency, and the loan calculator will display the payment either on a bi-weekly or monthly basis; 
Forth - Users can delete any of the loans, and the loan calculator will adjust the payments accordingly;

Design - I chose white and yellow colors with a Montserrat font size of 16px. I believe this color palette improves user experience by simplifying the data consumption. Because in color psychology, the yellow color is associated with fun and cheapness, which coincides with the fact that my app being publicly available and for free.
